The VR showcase "Hunting for Khubilai Khan" allows the audience to dive into the
boundless desert, and hunt down the preys. The player plays as the Khubilai Khan,
and experience the intense and fun of hunting by sitting on the horse-riding machine,
and a bow-simulating hand-held device.

# [VR in National Palace Musuem: Fisherman's Delight](fishing.md)

> This creation takes place at the Jinming Pool in the Song Dynasty. Back then it was a
huge pool in the royal garden of Kaifeng; the royal family used to enjoy the beauty and
fish by the pool bank. In our showcase the player becomes a member of the imperial family,
and fish leisurely with actually feeling of the fishes' struggle.
