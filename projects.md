# Hunting for Khubilai Khan - VR showcase in National Palace Musuem
<br>
The VR showcase "Hunting for Khubilai Khan" allows the audience to dive into the
boundless desert, and hunt down the preys. The player plays as the Khubilai Khan,
and experience the intense and fun of hunting by sitting on the horse-riding machine,
and a bow-simulation hand-held device.
