<p>I’m a master student enrolled in the <strong>Institute of Multimedia Engineering</strong> of National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan. My research area is <strong>Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)</strong>, mainly focused on exploring possible interaction between real world and the virtual world.</p>

<p>I persued my bachelor’s degree in the department of <strong>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</strong> of NCTU, from which I gained EE-related knowledge such as circuit design. Since I switched to the area of Computer Science for my master’s degree, I therefore consider myself more as a <strong>computer engineer</strong> rather than a pure hardware engineer or a computer scientist.</p>

<p>Beside research, what I enjoy in my free time are reading and all the good food. I also like to cook, and love to spend plenty of time on discussing what’s the recipe of a cusine with others. In my opinion, food is the best common language that all human kind share, and the best way to make friends.</p>
