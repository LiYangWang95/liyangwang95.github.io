## Bio

Hi, I'm LiYang, just call me Leon. Pronouciation? Well, think of **Leon**ardo DiCaprio, then you get it :) I've been a PDEng Trainee in Software Technology at Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands since October 2020.

I graduated from the **Institute of Multimedia Engineering** of National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan. My research area was **Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)**, and focused on exploring possible interaction between real world and the virtual world.  

I persued my bachelor's degree in the department of **Electrical Engineering and Computer Science** of NCTU, from which I gained EE-related knowledge such as circuit design. Since I switched to the area of Computer Science for my master's degree, I therefore consider myself more as a **computer engineer** rather than a pure hardware engineer or a computer scientist.

Beside working, what I enjoy in my free time are reading and all the good food. I also like to cook, and love to spend plenty of time on discussing what's the recipe of a cusine with others. In my opinion, food is the best common language that all human kind share, and the best way to make friends.
