## Bio

Hi, I'm LiYang, just call me Leon. Pronouciation? Well, think of **Leon**ardo DiCaprio, then you get it :) I'm currently working as a Finance Specialist - IT Interface at Delta Electronics EMEA and am responsible for the digital transformation of the team.  

I graduated from the **PDEng Software Technology program** at Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands in October 2022. During my study I participated in multiple company-collaborating projects, including a 10-month project with Royal Philips, and gained a lot of experience as software engineer/ architect.  

I persued my master's degree from the **Institute of Multimedia Engineering** of National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan. My research area was **Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)**, and focused on exploring possible interaction between real world and the virtual world.  

Beside working, what I enjoy in my free time are reading and all the good food. I also like to cook, and love to spend plenty of time on discussing what's the recipe of a cusine with others. In my opinion, food is the best common language that all human kind share, and the best way to make friends.  

As for outdoor activities cycling is always my top choice. I love the feeling biking through meadows and enjoy the scenary around. If you are interested, let me know when we can go for a ride!
