This creation takes place at the Jinming Pool in the Song Dynasty. Back then it was a
huge pool in the royal garden of Kaifeng; the royal family used to enjoy the beauty and
fish by the pool bank. In our showcase the player becomes a member of the imperial family,
and fish leisurely with actually feeling of the fishes' struggle.
