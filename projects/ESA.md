# Autonomous Classification of Mars' Terrain

The project “Autonomous Classification of Mars' Terrain” is a training project involving the Software Technology PDEng Program of TU/e and European Space Agency(ESA). The project’s goal is to classify images of Mars' terrain.
&nbsp;  
Within the project I played the role as **Engineer/ Configuration Manager** in the team.
&nbsp;  

## Personal Contributions

I was majorly involved in the research stage. I analyzed the images provided by ESA pixel by pixel and reported analysis to the charateristic of these images. In addition, I also suggested various methods to utilize these features.  
&nbsp;  

### Major Contribution 1: : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding the data is a key part in the project; only if we have a proper learning of the data can we deliver a suitable technique. Taking this in consideration, the team decided to contribute to Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) first. I analyzed the images based on their grayscale values and class labels.  
&nbsp;  

### Major Contribution 2: Configuration Management Plan

As the configuration manager, I contributed to setting up the configuration management plan. It was completed in the early stage of the project, and shall be followed by all members. I also modified several standards upon request and actual needs.  
&nbsp;  

### Major Contribution 3: Introducing Jenkins Service

To allow for auto logging the results, the architect team introduced the Jenkins service. I participated in the testing phase of the service, and gave an introduction of how to utilize the service to the whole team.  
&nbsp;  

### Additional Contributions

a) Fulfilled responsibility by completing all user stories assigned  
b) Setting up easy-understanding slides for each update session  
c) Assistance in smart patching task: analysis of grayscale for unlabeled areas
