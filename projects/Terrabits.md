# TERRABITS

The project “TERRABITS” is a training project involving members of the Software Technology PDEng Program of TU/e and Airbus. The project’s goal is to establish a connection between aircrafts and other devices.
&nbsp;  
Within the project I played the role as **Engineer/ Software Architect** in the team.
&nbsp;  

## Personal Contributions

I was majorly involved in the research stage. To establish a solid foundation for the project, I conveyed research for the mathematical part in the project and suggested suitable architecture and implementation.  
&nbsp;  

### Major Contribution 1: Clarifying Service Level Agreement (SLA)

One of the team’s first tasks was defining the connecting parameters and standards for these parameters. This is referred to as setting up the Service Level Agreement(SLA), which is considered as an agreement for connection quality. I contributed to setting up a list of parameters that shall be taken into account when developing a network; they can be utilized as a measure for ‘good network’. The list was established based on research results and discussions with the stakeholders.  
&nbsp;  

### Major Contribution 2: Design & Implement Priority Calculation Methods

A crucial steps for the establishing a optimal network is deciding which devices to connect to; in other words, the system must judge which neighboring network node has a higher connection priority. We named the method for calculating the priority as Priority Calculation Method(PCM), and I was involved in designing and implementing PCMs using SLA parameters defined.  
&nbsp;  

### Major Contribution 3: Clarifying User Requirements

As the software architect for the project, I was responsible for clarifying the user requirements. Together with Shubham and Dan, we listed all requirements we derived from the discussion with Airbus, and documented in detail together with their acceptance criteria.  
&nbsp;  

### Major Contribution 4: Architectural Decision Document

As part of the deliverables, the Architectural Decision Document(ADD) is the document that shall be written by the architect that documents all architectural decisions. I also contributed in establishing the document and ensured its content and quality met the stakeholders’ requirements.  
&nbsp;  

### Additional Contributions

a) Fulfilled responsibility by completing all user stories assigned  
b) Setting up easy-understanding slides for each update session
