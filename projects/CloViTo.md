# Cloud-Native Sleep Data Visualization Tool

The project “Cloud Native Sleep Data Visualization Tool” is a training project involving the Software Technology PDEng Program of TU/e and Onera Health. The project’s goal is to develop a visualization tool for medical workers to examine the EEG signals recorded when the patients were sleeping; this tool will play a significant role in assisting analyzing  the analysis of the sleeping patterns by simplifying the EEG signals, and convert the signals into readable forms.  
&nbsp;
Within the project I played the rols as **Engineer/ Designer** in the frontend team. The team was responsible for designing and implementing all the following features:  
> a) Be able to receive raw data from local devices/end users  
b) Be able to extract and convert raw data into plottable files  
c) Be able to display a chart the user can interact with by allowing the user  
> i) to zoom in/out  
ii) to scroll horizontally/vertically through the chart(panning)  
iii) to make marks/annotations

## Personal Contributions

When it comes to motor controls, there are a number of parameters that affects the performance, and the parameters that indicate how the motor is working. For controlling the most important one is RPM, which the abbreviation for “revolution per minute”; the higher the value is, the faster the motor is spinning, which then leads to larger flow. As for monitoring performance not only the RPM value is important, but also the actual flow within the pipes.  
&nbsp;  
Considering the tasks that will be assigned to the system, measuring the flow in the pipe is necessary. Thus the key parameters I identified are a) the RPM values of each motor, and b) the current output flow rate.  
&nbsp;  
Judging from the research, the parameters and controls I put in the menu bar are:  
> a) Operation status  
b) Motor working frequency  
c) Operation mode  
d) Set value  
e) Feedback value  
f) Run/stop button

## The Refined Interface

<div
    class = "projectBox"
    >
    <table>
        <tr>
        <th
            style = "width: 50%;
                    height: 50%">
            <img
                src = "/images/intern/interface.png"
                alt = "The refined user interface(off)."
                style = "max-width: 95%;
                        max-height: 95%;
                        vertical-align: middle;"
                >
